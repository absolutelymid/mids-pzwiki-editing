{{Transcript/row|Commentator|Greetings America! You join us at Spearmint Field.<br>
The New York Swallows face the Chicago Bluejeans in the third game of the championship.<br>
All eyes are on Bigfoot Carroll, the Swallows' star outfielder, sure to knock a few home runs today.<br>
Dermody with a strong pitch... strike two...<br>
Bigfoot steps up to the plate.<br>
Tremendous anger in the stands, folks. It's like the German parliament up there!<br>
Bigfoot's keeping his cool.<br>
And he points to the center field! He's calling his shot!<br>
And... oh my goodness, what a hit by Bigfoot! Right where he pointed!<br>
The ball is going, going, going, high into the center-field stands...<br>
... and it is a home run! One for the history books!<br>

{{Transcript/row|Commentator 1|An iron is a better choice. Riverside is a tricky course, as we've seen.<br>
Lots of dog legs. But Hogan is a pro.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Commentator 2|Full power swing and... just short of the green.<br>
He might risk using the putter.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Annoucner 1|I would, Ken. It's a nice flat green for once.<br>
