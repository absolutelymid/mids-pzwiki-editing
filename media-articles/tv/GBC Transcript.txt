A miles-long fence topped with razor wire south of Louisville...<br>

The phones are down, and there's no way in or out.<br>

Were the Louisville Lights flares set by pranksters...<br>

{{Transcript/row|General McGrew|First and foremost: we are safe.<br>
America is safe.<br>
Today we can confirm that, yes,  the nature of the Knox Event is degenerative.<br>
It causes panic and confusion among sufferers<br>
Some of whom will then perform acts that are... un-American.<br>
The initial period of contagion is over.<br>
There is absolutely NO need for further panic.<br>
Panic... engendered by irresponsible and unofficial reporting.<br>
Sufferers are NOT deceased.<br>
We ARE establishing the likelihood of discovering a cure.<br>
At this stage the infection is passed  only through DIRECT fluid contact.<br>
This means bites. This means scratches.<br>
My thoughts are with those poor souls behind the Event line.<br>
But this is contained.<br>
It has always been contained.<br>
We are safe.<br>
America is safe.<br>
