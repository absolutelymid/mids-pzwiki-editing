Then I will go by Artist.<br>
No matter how deep we go, the tunnel never grows dark.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Poet|Foolish Artist. It grows dark if you shut your eyes.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Artist|You shut your eyes, Poet, and the tunnel will stay light for me.<br>
<dripping water><br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Poet|Yes, but I will soon fall behind, and without me, you too will lose your way.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Artist|I will not let you fall behind. Even should you fall blind.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Poet|Kind words, but I'm not sure I believe them...<br>
<distant scream echoes><br>
What was that?<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Artist|An unkindness.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Poet|Dear God, are we descending into Hell?<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Artist|You who rejects God are afraid of Hell?<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Poet|I reject God. But Hell is real. Every fool knows that.<br>
The only hope I have left is to break through Hell to the other side.<br>
Is there anything else we can hope for?<br>

}}
{{Transcript/row|Loveheart|Well he's not now. I'm Mark Loveheart. What's your name?<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Charlene|Charlene. My shift's over. For good. Can you give me a lift?<br>
<bzzt><br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Developer|This Loveheart is becoming something of a bother. He beat up all our men.<br>
At this rate, our toxic waste dump will never be built on top of the football pitch.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Thug|You leave Loveheart to me. I know a man who'll make short work of him.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Charlene|You can't live like this. Fighting and hurting people, for money.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Loveheart|You don't get to JUDGE ME!<br>

{{Transcript/row|Developer|You little bastard Loveheart. You won't stand in our way.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Loveheart|Drop the gun. We'll fight like men.<br>

Have a nice day.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Loveheart|I'm sorry for shouting at you Charlene.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Charlene|You've stopped the developers and saved the town.<br>
So I forgive you, Loveheart.<br>
<kissing noises><br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Loveheart|And so we left the town behind. In the pub I left my card.<br>
"For when the law's not good enough. For when the rules need to be bent.<br>
For when there's no-one left to turn to. Call Loveheart."<br>

{{Transcript/row|Roger|Hi, I'm Roger Triskel, movie critic for the Louisville Sun-Times...<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Susan|... and I'm Susan Bauman, movie critic at the Louisville Dispatch.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Roger|Apologies for any sound issues in today's show, we're recording via telephone.<br>
<fzzt><br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Susan|We spoke with the producers and...<br>
... couldn't rightly allow the crew to put themselves at...<br>
<bzzt><br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Roger|We're recording on July 14. Let's hope things haven't gotten any worse.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Susan|We don't have any movies to review, so we decided...<br>
... to talk about the future of cinema if this continues.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Roger|It's not looking good, Susan. All those people packed up tight indoors...<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Susan|We could see a big return in outdoor theaters.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Roger|That's right. And drive-ins. But if this situation continues for months...<br>
<fzzt><br>
... will feel the pinch.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Susan|You can't film movies with the actors partitioned off, or in different places.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Roger|Second only to the human toll, of course, the toll on culture could be immense.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Susan|Yes. Even in the darkest periods of the twentieth century...<br>
... we've had the cinema to cheer us up.<br>
I first fell in love with movies because they were...<br>
... a huge comfort after my mom died.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Roger|It's deeply sad. Stay safe, Susan.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Susan|You too, Roger.<br>
