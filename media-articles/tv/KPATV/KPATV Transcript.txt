Senator, what is the state government doing about the crumbling roads...<br>

Governor Fairweather is a great man who's done his best...<br>
... I've known Cal for years, but he can be a little naïve in his dealings...<br>
... with Washington, especially with a... Democrat as President.<br>
Right now, I'm trying to secure funding to expand bridge inspection...<br>

What up techheads? Stacey Fine bringing you all the latest Nerd News!<br>
We've got an exclusive preview of the game everyone wants...<br>
PAWS: The Movie - The Game!<br>
Made by Kerald Games, makers of the "CyberKiller 2" tie-in shooter...<br>
... the "Dark Agent" platformer, and the Dog Goblin point-and-click adventure...<br>
... PAWS: The Movie - The Game is a unique blend of platforming and fighting...<br>
... as our favorite cuddly animal friends duke it out...<br>
... to see who's the cutest critter in the forest.<br>
With gorgeous 16-bit graphics, three game modes, and six characters...<br>
... along with a few secret ones to unlock...<br>
... this is sure to be the game others have to beat in 1993.<br>
Over to you, Will!<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Will|Thanks Stacey! Playing games on a screen is great, but the future is even more immersive.<br>
Affordable virtual reality headsets are here - and they are the true future of gaming.<br>
Imagine being able to explore an exotic city, a forbidden temple...<br>
... or a haunted house, rather than just watching it on screen...<br>
... and all in three dimensions!<br>
Headsets are available for under $1000...<br>
... and within a couple of years, every game will use this technology!<br>

Craft's back up quickly, his Dual Powerhouse Rock Tumbler knocks Zhi-Mei out!<br>
Round 2. Anna's holding back and... a Titan Flurry Fistshake knocks down Craft.<br>
Zhi-Mei's juggling Craft in the air with a Revolving Door Twister - Jerry can't do a thing about it!<br>
Round 2 goes to Anna and Zhi-Mei.<br>
Final round. Craft does his Special Forces Ankle Snapper...<br>
... but Zhi-Mei jumps over it and sends Craft flying with a Boxed-In Cantaloupe Blast!<br>
It's a Ponytail Tornado Triple Dragon Drift... and Craft is KO'ed!<br>
Anna Oh is the new World Champion of Street Combat II!<br>

Today I'm interviewing state Senator Richard Bledsoe...<br>

Senator, what is the state government doing about the crumbling roads...<br>

{{Transcript/row|Richard|It's well known Louisville has been chronically underfunded by the federal government...<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Paula|So this is a federal problem?<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Richard|Much as I am for small government, the fact is modern infrastructure requires federal funding.<br>
Governor Fairweather is a great man who's done his best...<br>
... I've known Cal for years, but he can be a little naïve in his dealings...<br>
... with Washington, especially with a... Democrat as President.<br>
Right now, I'm trying to secure funding to expand bridge inspection...<br>
... on the Ohio river bridges in Louisville...<br>
... but funding is tied up in so many sub-committees, it's frustrating.<br>

America is safe.<br>
Today we can confirm that, yes,  the nature of the Knox Event is degenerative.<br>
It causes panic and confusion among sufferers<br>
Some of whom will then perform acts that are... un-American.<br>
The initial period of contagion is over.<br>
There is absolutely NO need for further panic.<br>
Panic... engendered by irresponsible and unofficial reporting.<br>
Sufferers are NOT deceased.<br>
We ARE establishing the likelihood of discovering a cure.<br>
At this stage the infection is passed  only through DIRECT fluid contact.<br>
This means bites. This means scratches.<br>
My thoughts are with those poor souls behind the Event line.<br>
But this is contained.<br>
It has always been contained.<br>
We are safe.<br>
America is safe.<br>

{{Transcript/row|Ashling|Great to meet you, Alva.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Alva|Now, you started off with abstract paintings...<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Ashling|Yes. After my training, I turned towards simple and truly abstract shapes...<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Alva|Chromatic Accident is a personal favorite.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Ashling|Thank you. But I found when something was so open to interpretation...<br>
... it can nullify the intended effect, instead of amplifying it.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Alva|And you turned to more political themes...<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Ashling|Yes. Perhaps too political early on. You want to rise above party politics.<br>
My favorite from that period is 48 Saucepans Falling Down the Stairs.<br>
My mother had just had a bad fall in the kitchen...<br>
... and it was inspired by a nightmare I had soon after.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Alva|Interesting. The mother figure, I think, plays a large role in your work...<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Ashling|It's hard to talk about the themes of your own work.<br>
It's like thinking about your fingers as you play the piano...<br>
... you can actually forget how to do it.<br>
But my own mother has a large part in my life and work.<br>
My ultimate goal is to do a simple, realist painting of my mother's face.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Alva|That's very sweet, actually.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|Ashling|Yes, but it's true. That's something I feel I need great bravery to do.<br>
All art is a reduction, in a way, and it can feel... wrong...<br>

Today, right here in studio, we're hosting...<br>

You'll be playing as Lord Craft, Jerry.<br>
Can you tell us why he's your favorite character?<br>

... ultimate Street Combat II champion!<br>
Jerry's taking an early lead with Lord Craft...<br>
... Anna's jumped over his Ultra Low Leg Brush and, oh, she's knocked him down!<br>
Craft's back up quickly, his Dual Powerhouse Rock Tumbler knocks Zhi-Mei out!<br>
Round 2. Anna's holding back and... a Titan Flurry Fistshake knocks down Craft.<br>
Zhi-Mei's juggling Craft in the air with a Revolving Door Twister - Jerry can't do a thing about it!<br>
Round 2 goes to Anna and Zhi-Mei.<br>
Final round. Craft does his Special Forces Ankle Snapper...<br>
... but Zhi-Mei jumps over it and sends Craft flying with a Boxed-In Cantaloupe Blast!<br>
It's a Ponytail Tornado Triple Dragon Drift... and Craft is KO'ed!<br>
Anna Oh is the new World Champion of Street Combat II!<br>
Incredible! See you next time, gamers!<br>

This is our first real episode of our new show about...<br>
... surviving in our new world.<br>
We don't know who you are or where you are, but we'll give some tips to help you.<br>
Even after the water's turned off, there's still some left in the faucet.<br>
If you have to collect it from the river or even puddles, boil it first.<br>
Make sure there are no bodies in the water.<br>
And when you dispose of bodies, it's best to burn them.<br>
Save the effort of digging graves for your loved ones.<br>
That's all from me today.<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|Quentin|Hi, I'm Quentin. Used to work at this station so I thought I'd tell you a little about our setup.<br>
We've got two big generators to power the transmitter...<br>
They were kept fully fueled so they should last a while.<br>
We only do one broadcast a day, pre-taped, but we don't bother editing it.<br>
We have a good sturdy fence and we're at the edge of town, so the infected stay away.<br>
Ninety percent of a safe place is its location.<br>
Obviously, cities mean zombie hordes, but being too rural...<br>
... mean you can't find supplies so easy.<br>
Remember to scout before you move location, like we did.<br>
Moving's about the most dangerous thing you can do, laden down with stuff...<br>
And always have somewhere secure you can fall back to.<br>
Even a couple days of food in a safe location away from your base...<br>
... could mean the difference between life and death. Thanks.<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|Frank|Hello, Frank Williams again. We've started some long term planning.<br>
Maybe you have too.<br>
Stuff's already rotted on the store shelves.<br>
What do we do when the cans run out?<br>
There's no point in waiting for trucks full of stuff to arrive from the interstate.<br>
We're going to have to farm, fish and forage.<br>
We're far from experts, but there's lots of books on this stuff.<br>
Even the instructions on a packet of seeds...<br>
... can tell you basically all you need to know.<br>
Here's some pictures from a book about mushrooms we found.<br>
These ones are poison, and these ones are safe to eat.<br>
Same with these berries.<br>
Right now, we're going to have to look after ourselves.<br>
Good luck.<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|Maria|Hi, it's Maria here.<br>
Thanks everyone for getting in touch over the radio.<br>
Never knew there were so many survivors.<br>
I'm going to read out a few names and messages y'all sent me.<br>
Shonda Younger says, "It's just me and my daughter now, in my father's garage...<br>
... on the outskirts of Frankfort. We were about to give up...<br>
... until we saw your broadcast. Thank you for giving us hope."<br>
Thank you for watching, Shonda.<br>
This is from Callie in Daviess County. "Could you give us some tips on...<br>
... using knives against the infected?"<br>
Yes, I'll get Frank to talk about that in a moment.<br>
So many more messages. I'll just read out the names.<br>
Janet Gruber and Carmelita Hein, Pippa Passes.<br>
Merle and Van Pearce, and Parker Castle, Crossgate.<br>
Nita Wallace, Nelda Fortner, and Colette and Sergio Parkinson...<br>
... all in Douglass Hills.<br>
Stay in touch, everybody.<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|Frank|Hello, Frank Williams again. We've got our first sprouts in our vegetable garden.<br>
No tips today. Just a kind of stock-taking.<br>
None of us ever thought we'd make it this far.<br>
And we're going to have to fight to build a new world...<br>
... on top of all this shit, pardon my French.<br>
I never thought I'd get used to the sight of shambling corpses...<br>
... but as long as they're not chasing me, they're getting pretty boring.<br>
I've been in AA for eight years. Thank God the liquor store's so far away.<br>
Anyway, I'm rambling. Maria's talking about doing some entertainment...<br>
... music and such, but none of us know much about it.<br>
Keep fighting out there, Kentucky. God bless.<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|Maria|Maria here. We had a... bad night.<br>
We debated whether to talk about it on-air.<br>
But we don't want to pretend we don't have problems.<br>
Around 10.30 last night we heard a noisy car coming from town.<br>
We knew it was trouble.<br>
We don't have any lights outside. Maybe they heard our broadcast...<br>
The car pulled up near us and the people inside starting yelling.<br>
Three teenagers. They were drunk or high or something.<br>
And they had guns.<br>
They said to bring 'em out food or they'd burn us down.<br>
They were laughing about it, but they weren't joking.<br>
Quentin went out to talk with them and they...<br>
... shot him in the arm. We need a doctor to look after him.<br>
We have a few guns and we fired back.<br>
We hit a girl in the head. She was no more than sixteen...<br>
Anyway, we need a doctor.<br>
You know our radio frequency. Please get in touch...<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|Quentin|Hi, I'm Quentin. We've been off air for a while because the horde arrived.<br>
Knocked down the fence. They got Frank, Melissa and Sammie.<br>
We had to... finish Sammie off. She got bit.<br>
<nowiki>*</nowiki>stifled sob<nowiki>*</nowiki><br>
We led the horde away over the last couple of days...<br>
... they're scattered all over the neighborhood now...<br>
... they trampled the vegetable garden...<br>
... and the generators are running low on fuel.<br>
The local gas station blew up on the first day.<br>
I don't know.<br>
We should have joined up with a bigger group.<br>
Anyway, I guess the thing is to keep fighting even if you don't feel like it.<br>
And we really don't feel like it now.<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|Maria|Maria here. <cough> It's over. Quentin bit me. I'm safe here for now, at least.<br>
This was a fun little experiment. Someone else wants to try...<br>
... you know where the studio is.<br>
Just try and bury us. <cough><br>
Thanks for joining me, Kentucky.<br>
Here's a recording of my favorite song...<br>
... which my grandmother used to sing to me. See you all again one day.<br>
