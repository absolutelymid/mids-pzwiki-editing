{{Transcript/row|Monologue|Hello everyone in the class of '93.<br>
If I can offer you one piece of advice, it would be: always wear comfortable shoes.<br>
Science has proven how helpful shoes can be. The rest of my advice is merely based on my own, confusing life.<br>
♪<br>
Keep a spare pair of pants in your car at all times. It might just save your life.<br>
Learn how to turn on a generator, and open a can without an opener.<br>
Smile at the mailman, even if he gives you bills. It's not his fault.<br>
♪<br>
Dance, especially if they tell you not to.<br>
Walk a little further than you had planned. Go to bed a little earlier than usual.<br>
Remember that your boss is probably as bored as you are.<br>
Your beauty will fade, but your kindness will last.<br>
And remember: ALWAYS wear comfortable shoes.<br>
