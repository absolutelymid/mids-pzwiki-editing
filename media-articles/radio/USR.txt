Lore Tidbits
------------
CDC has tons of underground facilities making bioweapons
Knox infection looks like what is called Juniper-17
Theory: the CDC is testing a bioweapon on the population to gather data
Residents of West Point injected serum that "made them collapse and not be themselves anymore"
Injection seems to have hallucinogenic properties
"Area 51" slipped through the static interference on July 13
Property in Arkansas seized by the government due to a "bottomless pit"
The army's MEGA-MIX plan: drafted in the seventies, involving creating work camps to work dissidents to death
Exclusion Zone and military deployment in cities is literally this plan!!1!11!1!

Trivia
------
USR airs the song [[I Swear]] by Hank Gilmore twice, though the name of the love interest differs between the airings ("Sue" the first time around, "Kelly" the second). The CD itself plays the second variation, with "Kelly" as the love interest.
