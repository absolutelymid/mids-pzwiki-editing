Shocking pictures have emerged from the Exclusion Zone.<br>
Earlier today the President discussed a 'receding likelihood'...<br>
{{tooltip|... of recovery for those afflicted by the Knox Event.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|Photography leaked from the Exclusion Zone, however, paints a...|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
... more extreme picture.<br>
{{tooltip|Some listeners will find the following description disturbing.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|The photo is of a street, but in focus is a man.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
His age, around thirty. His clothing bloodstained.<br>
One arm is by his side.<br>
{{tooltip|The other is missing.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
A horrific jagged wound at the elbow. He looks like the victim of a bomb blast.<br>
Behind him, out of focus, what appear to be bodies lie on the ground.<br>
{{tooltip|But the man is unconcerned, his gaze blank, oblivious to his wound and the scene.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|We have established the veracity of this photograph.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|It was taken in West Point, inside the Knox Event Zone.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|We would remind listeners that the official message is still: The Knox Event is contained.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|The public have been shielded, rightly or wrongly, from the truth.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
But the Knox Event IS contained.<br>

I can confirm there has been an outbreak.<br>

There is NO evidence of fatalities within the Exclusion Zone.<br>
We are using judged and judicious force to maintain the border.<br>
Warning shots have been fired.<br>
No civilians have been harmed.<br>
We must ensure that this infection is not allowed to spread.<br>
I am in hourly contact with the President on this matter.<br>
The no-fly zone will remain in place for the foreseeable future.<br>

With official channels silent, we have collated key information.<br>
{{tooltip|The Knox Event infection is spread through direct contact with sufferers.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
At one point it was spread more easily. We don't know how.<br>
Now, however transmission is possible.<br>
The Knox Event infection has a variable incubation period.<br>
After incubation the loss of rational thought is seemingly inevitable.<br>
{{tooltip|Sufferers will attack each other, and non-sufferers.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
There is no known cure.<br>
We are expecting an official statement on these revelations imminently.<br>
{{tooltip|We would like to thank Kirsty Cormick on the ground in Kentucky...|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
... for this information.<br>
{{tooltip|We know you're all inside watching this but...|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{Transcript/row|person2|Good evening. The President has spoken out on the Knox Event.<br>
Speaking after a consultation with the Center for Disease Control...<br>
{{tooltip|... he addressed journalists in the White House press room.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person1|{{tooltip|This is a distressing time.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
The situation in Kentucky is unexpected and saddening.<br>
{{tooltip|My first thoughts are with the friends and families of those within the Zone.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|People have been separated, folk have been evacuated...|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|I understand the difficulties facing us.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|However, I have faith in the fine people of the Center for Disease Control...|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
... to get to the root of the panic and confusion within the Exclusion Zone.<br>
I have faith in our Servicemen and Women to fulfill their duties...<br>
{{tooltip|... and for General John McGrew to command them with the foresight and dedication...|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
... he has shown throughout his exemplary career.<br>
{{tooltip|It is a distressing time America, but you are in safe hands.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
Thank you.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person2|This came after a statement from General John McGrew...<br>
{{tooltip|... on the border line of the Event itself.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person3|There are many rumors circulating. Many falsehoods.<br>
{{tooltip|This is an appeal for calm.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|I can confirm there has been an outbreak.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
The ailment is, as yet, unidentified.<br>
{{tooltip|It is flu-like. It leads to panic. It leads to confusion.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
There is NO evidence of fatalities within the Exclusion Zone.<br>
{{tooltip|We are using judged and judicious force to maintain the border.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|Warning shots have been fired.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|No civilians have been harmed.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
We must ensure that this infection is not allowed to spread.<br>
I am in hourly contact with the President on this matter.<br>
{{tooltip|The no-fly zone will remain in place for the foreseeable future.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
At this time, we will take no questions.<br>

{{tooltip|They've got experts!|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|They've got people doing tests right now!|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
If you don't know yet, it's because they don't want to misinform.<br>
They don't want panic.<br>

{{Transcript/row|person3|This is America. The common man is being attended to.<br>

{{Transcript/row|person2|{{tooltip|Okay.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{Transcript/row|person3|{{tooltip|I think I know what you're suggesting, and my answers are threefold.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|First, that's classified.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|Second, very clearly not.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{Transcript/row|person3|{{tooltip|No Diane. No it is not.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
We've got some angry people here.<br>

Security is high here today, Diane. Lots of uniforms, lots of nervous faces.<br>

{{Transcript/row|person2|Are we expecting any further statements from the President?<br>

{{Transcript/row|person3|We know he's locked in meetings with the Center for Disease Control...<br>

{{Transcript/row|person2|{{tooltip|Okay well let's just hope they do that peacefully and calmly. Thank you Phil.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{tooltip|The President has just addressed the nation, and truths have been told.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{Transcript/row|person1|{{tooltip|It is time to face facts. It is time to settle down.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|We only ask for your responsible actions as an American citizen.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|I, personally, take responsibility for the perceived lack of communication.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|And for the rumor-mongering that has grown around the so-called 'Knox Event'.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|At this time we have no reason to believe residents of Kentucky will not recover.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|However, as the picture clears, and more information is made available...|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|... its likelihood is starting to recede.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
We have been hesitant to discuss specifics, yes, but with reason.<br>
The Knox Event IS contained, but its panic and confusion are not.<br>
We wanted to establish facts, but public alarm has not provided enough time.<br>
{{tooltip|From 6pm tonight there will be curfews in some of our biggest cities.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
This is for your protection. Please do not leave your house.<br>
{{tooltip|Please have faith in both our military and our emergency services.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|I ask our journalistic community to report responsibly.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{Transcript/row|person3|{{tooltip|The picture that's being painted for us isn't pretty, Diane.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

They have been let through, we don't know why, by the Army.<br>
They have been held in a local military base in...<br>

{{tooltip|They are scared, hungry and come with shocking revelations.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
First came the fever, then came violence and a hunger for blood.<br>

{{tooltip|Not all are with us now.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{tooltip|There is now a renewed anger all along the camps on the boundary.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{tooltip|First and foremost: we are safe.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|America is safe.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|Today we can confirm that, yes,  the nature of the Knox Event is degenerative.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|It causes panic and confusion among sufferers|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
Some of whom will then perform acts that are... un-American.<br>
The initial period of contagion is over.<br>
{{tooltip|There is absolutely NO need for further panic.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
{{tooltip|Panic... engendered by irresponsible and unofficial reporting.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
Sufferers are NOT deceased.<br>
We ARE establishing the likelihood of discovering a cure.<br>
At this stage the infection is passed  only through DIRECT fluid contact.<br>
This means bites. This means scratches.<br>
My thoughts are with those poor souls behind the Event line.<br>
But this is contained.<br>
{{tooltip|It has always been contained.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>
We are safe.<br>
{{tooltip|America is safe.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

{{Transcript/row|person4|{{tooltip|Do you have evidence for this?|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

The Knox Event infection is sweeping through Louisville.<br>
{{tooltip|WBLN has obtained the following pictures.|Boredom {{mood|-1}} }}<br>

Instances of... reanimation are not yet active within the city limits.<br>

There is no word from the President or the Military beyond existing...<br>

What up techheads? Stacey Fine bringing you all the latest Nerd News!<br>
We've got an exclusive preview of the game everyone wants...<br>
PAWS: The Movie - The Game!<br>
Made by Kerald Games, makers of the "CyberKiller 2" tie-in shooter...<br>
... the "Dark Agent" platformer, and the Dog Goblin point-and-click adventure...<br>
... PAWS: The Movie - The Game is a unique blend of platforming and fighting...<br>
... as our favorite cuddly animal friends duke it out...<br>
... to see who's the cutest critter in the forest.<br>
With gorgeous 16-bit graphics, three game modes, and six characters...<br>
... along with a few secret ones to unlock...<br>
... this is sure to be the game others have to beat in 1993.<br>
Over to you, Will!<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person3|Thanks Stacey! Playing games on a screen is great, but the future is even more immersive.<br>
Affordable virtual reality headsets are here - and they are the true future of gaming.<br>
Imagine being able to explore an exotic city, a forbidden temple...<br>
... or a haunted house, rather than just watching it on screen...<br>
... and all in three dimensions!<br>
Headsets are available for under $1000...<br>
... and within a couple of years, every game will use this technology!<br>

You'll be playing as Lord Craft, Jerry.<br>
Can you tell us why he's your favorite character?<br>

{{Transcript/row|person3|Yeah, yeah, Lord Craft's the best because of his Quickstone Pilestep...<br>

{{Transcript/row|person2|Great! Now let's head over to the machines and see who's the...<br>
... ultimate Street Combat II champion!<br>
Jerry's taking an early lead with Lord Craft...<br>
... Anna's jumped over his Ultra Low Leg Brush and, oh, she's knocked him down!<br>
Craft's back up quickly, his Dual Powerhouse Rock Tumbler knocks Zhi-Mei out!<br>
Round 2. Anna's holding back and... a Titan Flurry Fistshake knocks down Craft.<br>
Zhi-Mei's juggling Craft in the air with a Revolving Door Twister - Jerry can't do a thing about it!<br>
Round 2 goes to Anna and Zhi-Mei.<br>
Final round. Craft does his Special Forces Ankle Snapper...<br>
... but Zhi-Mei jumps over it and sends Craft flying with a Boxed-In Cantaloupe Blast!<br>
It's a Ponytail Tornado Triple Dragon Drift... and Craft is KO'ed!<br>
Anna Oh is the new World Champion of Street Combat II!<br>
Incredible! See you next time, gamers!<br>

We're here at the old... uh, public access TV station.<br>
We don't know who's still got TV, but hopefully it's somebody.<br>
My father Paul was Popo the Clown.<br>
He got sick. He... he's gone now...<br>
... but he'd want us to use this station to help people.<br>
So that's what we're going to try and do.<br>

I don't have anything planned for today so I'll just say...<br>

We don't know who you are or where you are, but we'll give some tips to help you.<br>
Even after the water's turned off, there's still some left in the faucet.<br>
If you have to collect it from the river or even puddles, boil it first.<br>
Make sure there are no bodies in the water.<br>
And when you dispose of bodies, it's best to burn them.<br>
Save the effort of digging graves for your loved ones.<br>
That's all from me today.<br>

|text={{Transcript/row|person1|Hi, I'm Quentin. Used to work at this station so I thought I'd tell you a little about our setup.<br>
We've got two big generators to power the transmitter...<br>
They were kept fully fueled so they should last a while.<br>
We only do one broadcast a day, pre-taped, but we don't bother editing it.<br>
We have a good sturdy fence and we're at the edge of town, so the infected stay away.<br>
Ninety percent of a safe place is its location.<br>
Obviously, cities mean zombie hordes, but being too rural...<br>
... mean you can't find supplies so easy.<br>
Remember to scout before you move location, like we did.<br>
Moving's about the most dangerous thing you can do, laden down with stuff...<br>
And always have somewhere secure you can fall back to.<br>
Even a couple days of food in a safe location away from your base...<br>
... could mean the difference between life and death. Thanks.<br>

Maybe you have too.<br>
Stuff's already rotted on the store shelves.<br>
What do we do when the cans run out?<br>
There's no point in waiting for trucks full of stuff to arrive from the interstate.<br>
We're going to have to farm, fish and forage.<br>
We're far from experts, but there's lots of books on this stuff.<br>
Even the instructions on a packet of seeds...<br>
... can tell you basically all you need to know.<br>
Here's some pictures from a book about mushrooms we found.<br>
These ones are poison, and these ones are safe to eat.<br>
Same with these berries.<br>
Right now, we're going to have to look after ourselves.<br>
Good luck.<br>

Thanks everyone for getting in touch over the radio.<br>
Never knew there were so many survivors.<br>
I'm going to read out a few names and messages y'all sent me.<br>
Shonda Younger says, "It's just me and my daughter now, in my father's garage...<br>
... on the outskirts of Frankfort. We were about to give up...<br>
... until we saw your broadcast. Thank you for giving us hope."<br>
Thank you for watching, Shonda.<br>
This is from Callie in Daviess County. "Could you give us some tips on...<br>
... using knives against the infected?"<br>
Yes, I'll get Frank to talk about that in a moment.<br>
So many more messages. I'll just read out the names.<br>
Janet Gruber and Carmelita Hein, Pippa Passes.<br>
Merle and Van Pearce, and Parker Castle, Crossgate.<br>
Nita Wallace, Nelda Fortner, and Colette and Sergio Parkinson...<br>

Stay in touch, everybody.<br>

... but as long as they're not chasing me, they're getting pretty boring.<br>
I've been in AA for eight years. Thank God the liquor store's so far away.<br>

... music and such, but none of us know much about it.<br>
Keep fighting out there, Kentucky. God bless.<br>

We debated whether to talk about it on-air.<br>
But we don't want to pretend we don't have problems.<br>
Around 10.30 last night we heard a noisy car coming from town.<br>
We knew it was trouble.<br>
We don't have any lights outside. Maybe they heard our broadcast...<br>
The car pulled up near us and the people inside starting yelling.<br>
Three teenagers. They were drunk or high or something.<br>
And they had guns.<br>
They said to bring 'em out food or they'd burn us down.<br>
They were laughing about it, but they weren't joking.<br>
Quentin went out to talk with them and they...<br>
... shot him in the arm. We need a doctor to look after him.<br>
We have a few guns and we fired back.<br>
We hit a girl in the head. She was no more than sixteen...<br>
Anyway, we need a doctor.<br>
You know our radio frequency. Please get in touch...<br>

{{Transcript/row|person2|Hello everyone in the class of '93.<br>
If I can offer you one piece of advice, it would be: always wear comfortable shoes.<br>
Science has proven how helpful shoes can be. The rest of my advice is merely based on my own, confusing life.<br>
♪<br>
Keep a spare pair of pants in your car at all times. It might just save your life.<br>
Learn how to turn on a generator, and open a can without an opener.<br>
Smile at the mailman, even if he gives you bills. It's not his fault.<br>
♪<br>
Dance, especially if they tell you not to.<br>
Walk a little further than you had planned. Go to bed a little earlier than usual.<br>
Remember that your boss is probably as bored as you are.<br>
Your beauty will fade, but your kindness will last.<br>
And remember: ALWAYS wear comfortable shoes.<br>
♪<br>

{{Transcript/row|person3|Good evening, Don. In Kentucky I'm seeing something play out that's a long time coming.<br>
Back in the Seventies, the Army was working on a plan called MEGA-MIX.<br>
In times of trouble, dissidents were to be rounded up and put into camps...<br>
... where they would be worked to death.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person2|What? That's unbelievable.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person3|I know, but it's true.<br>
The Exclusion Zone is the first part of the plan in action.<br>
The military in the cities is the second part.<br>
The third part will be the suspension of the Constitution...<br>
... and the elimination of anyone not entirely loyal to the federal government.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person2|That's quite a story. What do you suggest we do?<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person3|Stock up on ammunition and head for the mountains.<br>
There's no virus, Don. It's all part of their lies.<br>
}}
{{Transcript/row|person2|Well, it looks pretty convincing to me.<br>
