Hello peeps! This month the project hasn't really gone forward too much, mostly because I got carried away modding the game. WHat I did do was work on the transcripts for PawsTV and Hitz FM, but that's about it. I'm also not aware of any other changes, hopefully Faalagorn mentions them somewhere if I did miss any.

Next month I will be finishing up the transcripts and then moving on to the randomized stories (assuming I suppress my modding addiction) so I guess there's that to look out for in the near future (yippee!).
