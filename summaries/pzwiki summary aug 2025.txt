Well, it's been a while since I've been really active on the wiki (for numerous reason too boring to list) and so I've neglected Project Lore for some time. However some amount of time had opened up near the end of August which allowed me to make some progress on rewriting the zombie article (which I admit is not really lore related). Although free time is still relatively more limited these days, and there's still a large amount of things I do off-site during these times, I'm now back to active wiki work!

So what's the game plan?

The first thing that has to happen before I actually return to whittling away at Project Lore is finishing the rewrite of the zombie article I started back in May, which currently still lacks the last few sections of the original article. Although the rewrite will probably need some peer-editing before being officially added, I'll count the task as completed once I actually get the initial draft filled out.

Once that has been "completed," I'll return to working on the randomized stories. Of these, the highest priority is splitting the building stories article as B42 adds a metric ton of new building stories that would make the current article too long. From there, the new stories will be added to the pre-existing categories in whatever order I eventually do them in, before concluding with the randomized basements.

Don't have much else to say other than that, until next summary!
