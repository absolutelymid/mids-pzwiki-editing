Oh hey, a Project Lore summary is here!

I did a bit of work tis month, but not much in terms of the project. What I did do was start work on splitting the building stories, but after a bit of that I got sidetracked with editing the vehicle articles and now with the rewrite of the zombie article.

That's basically it this month, unless Faalagorn knows of some secret contribution I missed.
