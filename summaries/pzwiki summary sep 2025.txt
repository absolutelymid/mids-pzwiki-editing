Hey people, although I was still too busy with coursework this month, I actually did some work on the wiki this time around. I did split a few more of the building stories into their own articles, as well as expanding the Knox Event article with some new lore from B42. I haven't, however, finished the zombie article rewrite, and I'm not in any particular rush to finish it as I wanted to prioritize Project Lore in the short term.

That's it, you may now return to your untimely demise in Knox Country.
