Hey people, mid here. I'm sort of back after a long break, mainly because coursework has gotten infinitely tougher. Although I wasn't able to do much during the holidays (and the seven games I've bought during the Winter Sale will likely affect my future output as well), I'm slowly returning to regularly contributing on the wiki.

The new priority going into the new year would be the randomized stories, as there is still a lot of work to do there and I would like those to be done before B42 hits stable (which probably means I have a lot of time). This means that the zombie article is going on the backburner, sad but that was a sidequest that is simply taking too long (because I'm a perfectionist), though it doesn't mean I've given up (far from that, actually). The hope is also to have it done before B42 stable. 

Apart from the wiki, I'm also returning to both modding and actually playing the game, after a rather dry 2025 where I didn't actually interact with the community much after around February. Hopefully this year I can contribute more to the community and actually have some fun, now that B42 is getting stabler and stabler with each update.

Happy 2026! And whatever you do don't eat the Spiffo nuggets...
