Hello and happy new year to survivors and zomboids alike!

Project Lore was pretty quiet for the first half of December due to most of our tasks being finished (except for [[User:Faalagorn]] and [[User:Calvy]]'s work on the in-game outifts), however with the release of (unstable) B42 we're now being forced back to work to try and integrate the new bits of lore into the wiki.

B42 has introduced a lot more lore, not least with the readable newspapers added, thanks to [[User:LethalCitizen]] for taking screenshots of the papers, analyzing some of the content in the papers and for putting relevant stuff into the articles. Work on integrating the B41 newspaper article with the new newspapers is still a work in progress. 

The update has also brought in some new annotated maps (scary), not only for the new towns but also random areas scattered around the map. [[User:Blevita]] has once again dropped in and begun work in this area, gathering screenshots of some of the new maps and adding links into the main annotated maps article, thanks to them for picking up the job.

[[User:Vaileasys]] meanwhile is helping out with revamping the book, magazine and comic book articles, mainly focused around the new titles that they have received. The sheer amount of titles is not making things easy, but they seem to have things under control so I'm not going to question it. 

As for me, I'm currently working on the articles for the new TV and radio stations, which mostly involves analyzing the transcripts for information and labeling the lines of dialogue/audio. I'm also preparing to start revamping the randomized stories articles, mostly to add in the new B42 stories, add in a few B41 stories that I had missed back when I was working on them, and to generally clean house. 

Overall, a lot of progress has been made and from multiple fronts, it's been a good month for the project, can't wait to see what lies up ahead in 2025.
