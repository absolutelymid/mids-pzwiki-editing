All floorboard/profession stories are found in RBBasic.java

Building/Survivor stories generation process

During chunk generation, for every building in the chunk:
1. The building is checked whether it has already been evaluated for building stories
2. Buildings with over 500 rooms are immediately disregarded right here
3. Valid building stories are checked against
    a. Buildings that the player "controls" (i.e. safehouses) are locked out of any building story
    b. Buildings without kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms are locked out of most building stories
        i. Exceptions are with "forced" building stories, which are always triggered typically at non-residential buildings (Spiffo's, Pizza Whirled), these stories are compiled into a list called forcedStory that is evaluated later, which varies depending on the building definition (invalid stories are not added)
    d. Buildings with spawn points and the house in the tutorial mode are immediately disregarded
4. Some stories are immediately spawned at this point (anything added into forcedStory):
    a. Building stories about specific locations are spawned in (Spiffo's, Pizza Whirled, etc)
    b. Specific unique building stories are also spawned at this stage (Nolan's, Jackie Jaye, etc)
    c. K&B is separately spawned at building coordinates X: 10744, y: 9409
5. A list of all survivor stories and any building stories without the isAlwaysDo flag is initialized (i.e. RBBurnt, RBLooted)
6. The base chance of a story being spawned is determined from the Randomized House sandbox option
    a. Never: 0%
    b. Extremely rare: 5%
    c. Rare: 10%
    d. Sometimes: 15%
    e. Often: 20%
    f. Very Often: 30%
    g. Always Tries: 100%
7. The calculated base percentage is then rolled, determining if the game will in fact spawn a story in the specified building at all
8. A hashmap of all stories in the game is complied with their respective chances
9. The total chances of every story in the hashmap are summed together and a number within the range of 0 to totalChance - 1 is generated (called "choice")
10. The game iterates through each story entry in the hashmap, adding its chance to a subtotal that is compared to "choice", until subtotal is larger than "choice"
11. The story that put subtotal over the limit is returned, or null is returned if nothing gets selected
(essentially the odds of a given story spawning once the game once at this stage is the chance of the story over the total chances of all stories)
12. If nothing is selected (null) the game stops trying to spawn a story
13. Another check is done ensuring the building is of the correct definition for the story and that the world time lines up with the minimum and maximum time range
14. The building is modified according to the story selected
